# How to build

In order to build the project you need:

* Ruby installed
* Jekyll installed (`gem install jekyll`)

After those requirements are met, move to this project and type into terminal:

```bash
jekyll serve --baseurl=
```
Afterwards visit ```localhost:4000``` to watch the page or take a look into the newly generated `_site` folder.
